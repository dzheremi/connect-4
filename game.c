/**
 * This requirement requires you to understand a little more about pointers.
 * We want you to understand that all pointers just point to another memory
 * address whether they are a single pointer, a pointer to a pointer, etc.
 * 
 * In this example, we want you to swap the pointers for two players. 
 * This will be called from \ref play_game with a call such as 
 * swap(&current, &other) and at the end of this function, current and
 * other's pointers will be swapped.
 * For example, if current points to the human player and other points to 
 * the computer player, at the end of this function, the player they point 
 * to will have been swapped. 
 * 
 * @param current the current player who has just completed their turn
 * @param other the next player whose turn it will be

/**
 * This is the heart of the game.
 * 
 * Firstly, you need to initialise the game by calling functions written 
 * for requirement 3. The rest of this function is then managing the game 
 * loop.
 *
 * Each player takes a turn to drop a token into a column on the game 
 * board. The task that needs to be performed will be different depending 
 * on whether this is a human or a computer player.
 *
 * Regardless of the player type, you will need to display the board as it 
 * was before the player makes their move. If the current player is a 
 * computer player, we just need to select a column at random and drop a
 * token into that column. If there is no room, try another column.
 *
 * If the current player is a human player, your program will need to ask 
 * the user what column they wish to drop a token in. This input should be 
 * validated to check that it is numeric and within the range of allowed 
 * columns.
 * 
 * Once a valid move has been entered, your program should update the 
 * gameboard. It should then check if the game has been won lost or drawn 
 * by calling and the change the current player.
 *
 * This function also checks if the game has been won, lost or drawn by 
 * calling \ref test_for_winner(), and if the game is over, returns the 
 * winner to main or NULL if the game was a draw.

 * @param human a pointer to details about the human player
 * @param computer a pointer to details about the computer player
